# PRODIGY_ML_01
Welcome to the repository for my first internship project! This project focuses on building and evaluating a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to classify house prices. 
The goal is to predict the price range of houses based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms, and more.

TASK OVERVIEW:

In this task, we aim to:

1.Explore and Preprocess the Data: Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.

2.Build the MLR Model: Implement a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict house prices.

3.Evaluate the Model: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques.

4.Refine and Optimize: Improve the model through hyperparameter tuning and advanced feature selection

KEY FEATURES:

Comprehensive Data Analysis: In-depth exploration of the dataset to uncover insights and trends.

Robust Model Building: Step-by-step implementation of the MLR model, including feature selection and model validation.

Performance Evaluation: Use of metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model.

Optimization Techniques: Application of techniques to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.

CONTRIBUTING:

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

This TASK is part of my internship, and I would like to give my special thanks to ANDREW NG sir and PRODIGY for providing this opportunity.
