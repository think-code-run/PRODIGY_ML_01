# PRODIGY_ML_01
Welcome to the repository for my first internship project! This project focuses on building and evaluating a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to classify house prices. 
The goal is to predict the price range of houses based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms, and more.
